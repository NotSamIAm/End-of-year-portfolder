<p style="font-family: Courier">Mother Board(MOBO): This piece of hardware is the source of all computing power in the pc. this is a base board, which all other hardware is part of or connected to.<img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dd/MicroATX_Motherboard_with_AMD_Athlon_Processor_2_Digon3.jpg/220px-MicroATX_Motherboard_with_AMD_Athlon_Processor_2_Digon3.jpg"/></p>
<p style="font-family: Courier">Central Processing unit(CPU): This piece of hardware is used to direct and perform most of the computation in the computer. Depending on the varaety of motherboard, the variety of CPUs compatible with the motherboard will vary.<img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dc/Intel_80486DX2_top.jpg/220px-Intel_80486DX2_top.jpg"/></p>

<p style="font-family: Courier">Component communication: The components in a pc communicate through the circuts in the motherboard and other components.</p>
<p style="font-family: Courier">Keyboard, Mouse, and Monitor: These components allow for user imput, as well as visual representation of said user input. The keyboard allows for users to create text, and perform other actions with the keys. The mouse allows the user to select things, and to move objects on the screen.

<p style="color: #00CC00; font-family: Courier; font-size: 20">HTML, or hypertext markup language is the language that computers read webpages. Using html, the computer reads excatly how the website should look. When HTML is used, it is based entirely on an attribute called a "tag." These tags begin with a "'<" symbol, and end with a ">" symbol. Some examples af tags are "< p >" and the tag "< p >" with a slash in front  of the p. When there is a slash in front of the tag, it signifies the end of the tag's effect. <p style="color: #00CC00; font-family: Courier; font-size: 20"> Another program that can affetc HTML is called CSS. Css is a styling program that is used to affect large sections of HTML. using CSS, you can change paragraphs, and change the look of your website. For example, using CSS, I created the look of my text, by altering the background to make the box box you see, and the background color.
